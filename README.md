# 🦠 UA iGEM

Website for UA iGEM. iGEM is a collegiate and professional competition where teams from across the world make projects (generally using synthetic biology and genetic engineering) to make the world better. We intend to do the same. This website is meant to display our work and make others think about how they can improve the world through STEM in college.
